\textbf{About This Book}

This is material I have used to teach introductory level formal logic at Pomona 
College. The material is broken down to be doable in a 15 week semester with two 
sessions per week.

The proof system used in the book is the one Gentzen presents in his 
\citeyearpar{Gentzen1936}.
