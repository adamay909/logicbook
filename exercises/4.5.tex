 \item Suppose there is a derivation from \p{\seq{\Gamma}{s}} to \p{\seq{\Gamma}
  {t}}.  Explain why it follows that \p{\seq{}{s\limplies t}}. (Hint: you can 
  plug anything you want into \p{\Gamma}.)

 \answer{

  We can plug \p{s} into \p{\Gamma}. The supposition gives us that we can prove 
  \p{\seq{s}{t}}. We can then use \condI{} to get \p{\seq{}{s\limplies t}}.

 }


 \item Suppose \plsh{Cst} is a tautology. Explain why in that case the truth of 
  \p{s} guarantees the truth of \p{t}.

  \answer{ 

   If the truth of \p{s} did not guarantee the truth of \p{t}, \p{s\limplies t} 
   could be false and therefore would not be a tautology which contradicts the 
   supposition.

  }


  \item Suppose we can show that if \p{\seq{}{s\limplies t}}, then \plsh{Cst} is 
   a tautology. Explain why this would show that if there is a derivation from 
   \p{\seq{\Gamma}{s}} to \p{\seq{\Gamma}{t}}, then the truth of \p{s} 
   guarantees the truth of \p{t}.

\answer{

 From Q1 we know that if there is a derivation from \p{\seq{\Gamma}{s}} to 
 \p{\seq{\Gamma}{t}}, then \p{\seq{}{s\limplies t}}. Given our supposition for 
 this question, this means that \p{s\limplies t} is a tautology. But then by Q2, 
 it follows that the truth of \p{s} guarantees the truth of \p{t}.

}

  \item Suppose we can show that if \plsh{Cst} is a tautology, then \p{\seq{}
   {s\limplies t}}. Explain why this would show that if \plsh{Cst} is a 
   tautology, then there is a derivation from \p{\seq{\Gamma}{s}} to 
   \p{\seq{\Gamma}{t}}.

   \answer{

	We can construct the following derivation:

	\begin{argument*}

	 \ai{\Gamma}{s}{premise}
	 \ai{}{s\limplies t}{theorem}
	 \ai{\Gamma}{t}{1,2,\condE}

	\end{argument*}

	By the supposition, if \p{s\limplies t} is a tautology, line 2 in the above 
	derivation is correct.
