 \item Produce the tables of the remaining five possible truth conditions that

 \item Give an example of a compound sentence in English that is true on all 
  interpretations.

  \answer{ 

   \pp{The butler is the culprit} or the \pp{butler is not the culprit}.

  }
 \item Give an example of a compound sentence in English that is false on all 
  interpretations.

  \answer{
  \pp{The patron saint of modesty blesses himself} and \pp{the patron saint of 
  modesty does not bless himself}
 }

 \item Give an example of a compound sentence in English that is true on exactly 
  one interpretation but is not of the form \pp{A and B}.

  \answer{ 

   It is not the case that \pp{the Holy Roman Empire was Roman} and it is not 
   the case that \pp{the Holy Roman Empire was holy}.

Note 1: 

The following would not be a correct answer:

   \pp{It is not the case that the Holy Roman Empire was Roman} and \pp{it is not 
   the case that the Holy Roman Empire was holy}.

Which sentences we regard as atomic matters.

Note 2:

There are plenty of other possibilities (in fact, infinitely many).  E.g.

\begin{itemize}

 \item it is not the case that \pp{A or B}.

 \item Neither A nor B.

\end{itemize}

}



 \item Can you think of a way of saying the same thing as \pp{A and B} without 
  using the connective `and'?

\answer{
E.g.,

 it is not the case that \pp{\pp{it is not the case that A} or \pp{it is not the case that 
 B}}

}

\end{enumerate}
