This is material I have used for teaching introductory level formal logic at Pomona College. The coverage is fairly standard--propositional calculus and basic first-order logic--but includes a little bit of more advanced material that are often omitted, in particular proof of soundness and completeness of propositional calculus. The proof system is a natural deduction style sequent calculus that Gerhard Gentzen presents in his "Die Wiederspruchsfreiheit der reinen Zahlentheorie" (1936). Exercise material and a proof checker are available online.
